# ShopSyncer

ShopSyncer is a backend integration project for Shopify that allows merchants and developers to perform complete CRUD operations on Customers and Orders using the Shopify Admin GraphQL API. It also supports real-time webhook handling for order creation and pushes order data into a queue for background processing using RabbitMQ. MongoDB is used as the primary database for persisting customer and order data.

## 5. Webhook Flow

1. Shopify sends an `orders/create` event to `/webhooks/orders/create`.
2. The webhook is verified using HMAC SHA-256.
3. The verified payload is pushed to a RabbitMQ queue (`order_create_queue`).
4. The consumer (`queue/consumer.js`) listens to this queue and saves the order in MongoDB.

---

## 6. Security Practices

- `.env` and `certs/` are added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental leakage.
- Webhooks are verified using HMAC and the shared `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- HTTPS server uses SSL for secure local testing.

---

## 7. Testing with Postman

- Use POST requests to test:
  - `/shopify/customer/create`, `/shopify/order/create`, etc.
  - Webhook endpoint: `/webhooks/orders/create` with raw `application/json` and proper HMAC header.
- You can generate HMAC using `generateHmac.js` with your payload and secret.
